# ?? **Review System Notification Fix**

## ?? **Issue Identified**
You correctly identified that when a job is completed, pending reviews should be added for **both parties** (client and freelancer), but **reviewees weren't being notified when they received a review**.

## ? **What Was Already Working**
1. **Job completion notifications** - Both client and freelancer get notified when job is completed ?
2. **Pending reviews logic** - Both parties can see pending reviews in their dashboard ?  
3. **Review creation** - Both detailed and quick reviews work properly ?

## ?? **What Was Missing**
**Review notifications** - When someone submits a review, the reviewee (person being reviewed) wasn't getting notified that they received a new review.
