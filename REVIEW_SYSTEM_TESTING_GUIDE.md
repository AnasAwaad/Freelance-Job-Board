- ? Additional data (WouldRecommend, Tags, IsVisible)
- ? Timestamps (CreatedOn, LastUpdatedOn)

---

## ?? **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### Issue 1: "Unable to resolve service for type 'MediatR.IMediator'"
- **Solution**: Verify that `services.AddApplication()` is called in Program.cs ? (Already fixed)

### Issue 2: Review buttons not appearing
- **Check**: Job status is "Completed"
- **Check**: User is either the client or accepted freelancer
- **Check**: User hasn't already reviewed the job

### Issue 3: Database constraint errors
- **Check**: All required fields are populated
- **Check**: RevieweeId corresponds to a valid user
- **Check**: JobId exists and is valid

### Issue 4: Star ratings not working
- **Check**: JavaScript is enabled
- **Check**: CSS and JS files are loading properly
- **Verify**: Bootstrap and custom scripts are included

---

## ?? **Performance Considerations**

For production use, consider:
1. **Caching**: Cache average ratings for frequently viewed profiles
2. **Pagination**: Implement pagination for users with many reviews
3. **Indexing**: Add database indexes on RevieweeId, JobId, and IsVisible columns
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam reviews with rate limiting
